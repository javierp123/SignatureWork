# SignatureWork


In my time at St. Thomas  I took different courses that helped me well roundly and outside the box thinking to come be of problem solver and innovator. From python to java to SQL I have learned the skills to do Full Stack and that is because my classes at st Thomas. The first project I worked on was the coffee buyer which was written in java, It was to understand the object oriented programming.  I developed a mechanic shop management system using Python and SQLAlchemy. While the technical side involved building models, handling database queries, and implementing a user interface, I also designed the system with the real-world workflow of an automotive repair shop in mind. The core flow of the system reflects the actual operations of a mechanic shop. Customers can reserve appointments, which are assigned to available mechanics Each appointment can include various auto parts and results in an automatically generated invoice. I populated the database with commonly needed automotive parts like spark plugs, oil filters, and brake pads and etc. This simulates the inventory management that shops must perform to ensure they have parts available when needed by appointment or customer basis. The system incorporates both fixed service fees and variable part costs. Employees also have tracked labor hours, this gives the aspect of how labor contributes to job pricing. In actual auto shops, labor time is crucial for estimating quotes, so this was an important realism aspect to include. Each customer in the database includes personal information and their vehicle type. This supports appointment scheduling and invoice generation; this helps us understand how real shops maintain detailed customer records for communication and history tracking. Invoices are automatically generated after setting up an appointment, will need to change so you can edit an invoice at the end of appointment. This app simulates many operational elements of an automotive service center. By modeling not just data but also business logic specific to the automotive repair industry, I gained a better understanding of how software tools can be designed to align with and support real-world business workflows.!
